-- TODO 

- create a valid file structure for the projects
    - A python script which returns the processed datasets. 
    - extract the hidden states separately -> hidden states of the entire dataset saved as a new column 

- Other Models : larger QWEN 1-2.5

- hyperparameter tuning for the probes 
    - it should be done for each layer separately 

- create a 1 layers classifier as a probe 

git log + git checkout -> keep track of commit changes and revert back to the last commit 

regular commits (not necessarly pushing)

 
logbook on hackmd -> date, cleaner, short descriptions of papers, errors, good githubs, explaining to yourself in the logbook...
