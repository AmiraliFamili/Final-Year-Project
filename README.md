-- TODO 

- create a valid file structure for the projects
    - A python script which returns the processed datasets. 
    - extract the hidden states separately -> hidden states of the entire dataset saved as a new column 

- Other Models : larger QWEN 1-2.5

- hyperparameter tuning for the probes 
    - it should be done for each layer separately 

- create a 1 layers classifier as a probe 

git log + git checkout -> keep track of commit changes and revert back to the last commit 

regular commits (not necessarly pushing)

 
logbook on hackmd -> date, cleaner, short descriptions of papers, errors, good githubs, explaining to yourself in the logbook... 






TODO : 

    - more plots for comparing the accuracy
    - more datasets ? 
    - QWEN models -> 0.5, 7 and QwQ 2025
    - update the logbook
    - email to supervisor 
    - best hyperparameter setting -> try different probe designs
    - Logbook :::: 
    	-- The text for each cell should be longer, more detailed and it should have the links of the articles and resources used
	-- Write the main structure of the log book (generally what happened around that date). 
	-- logbook : some editor next to you that you put everything you did, what you learned and was important, summaries, MMMMOOOORRRRREEEEE detail, all the detail.
